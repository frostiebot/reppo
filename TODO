Flask Author appears to discourage the concept of stacking routes on a
single endpoint.

Instead, it is apparently "better" to make the "odd" routes return the
endpoint you wanted as a function call.

Meh.

TODO:

## NOTE (1)
1. lib/stats.py:63        If we want to revert back to grouping purely by extension

## TODO (28)
1. repo/views.py:68       format commit summary and commit date for per-object latest commit in template
2. repo/views.py:69       tree should probably be a table due to latest commit now available
3. repo/views.py:70       when path is not None show button to current_repo.commits at far right of breadcrumb
4. repo/views.py:71       lang summary - will require walking tree completely and dumping file extensions into a set (or a defaultdict that gets passed to a Counter)
5. repo/views.py:90       Make pagination cached in user session keyed by rev (pop last n revs)
6. repo/views.py:91       Recreate instance where path did not appear to be working
7. repo/views.py:111      see if we can get branches for commit without explosions
8. repo/views.py:126      limit display if file too big?
9. repo/views.py:127      clean up compilation and rendering of contributors (perhaps move contributor into Blob?)
10. repo/views.py:128     handle 404 differently (add to repo.handlers - check endpoint)
11. repo/views.py:152     limit raw display if file too big
12. repo/views.py:153     handle 404 differently (add to repo.handlers - check endpoint)
13. repo/views.py:169     everything.
14. repo/views.py:176     Probably cut this into distinct functions, since branches view is pretty detailed

15. lib/repo.py:123       ensure diff.find_similar behaves
16. lib/repo.py:132       Don't fully know how to work with this yet...
17. lib/repo.py:133       Need blob - match blob lines with BlameHunk lines, I guess

18. lib/diff.py:13        I don't think I really need this. (wish I could recall what I meant)
19. lib/diff.py:122       Make this less naive/verbose
20. lib/diff.py:186       make highlighting smarter - cover contiguous words rather than break
21. lib/diff.py:234       Make Patch.diffstat into Patch.raw_diffstat and add a @property to emit the desired result

22. lib/commit.py:29      'Signed-off-by: ...' can appear multiple times!
23. lib/commit.py:30      think harder about whether or not we want to simply remove signed-off-by or make it an attribute of the commit/author

24. lib/tree.py:44        if type is SYMLINK, we have to abspath (relatively, sigh) the target_ (ex. '../web_tabletcrs/crs', '/usr/tablet/web_tablethotels/pw')
25. lib/tree.py:45        last commit that touched this entry

26. lib/stats.py:20       No need to use groupby if using language_extensions
27. lib/stats.py:21       When returning percentage, template needs a threshold percent to group items into 'Other' (max three items - ie. 'Python 50%, Javascript 45%, Other 5%')

28. repo/converters.py:8  Abandon this for now... We will always need a string reference

ACTIVE:

*   /<repo_key>/blame/<rev>/<path:path> (ie. blame view of a blob). bleh.


DONE:

*   Switch to pygit2 (libgit2)

*   https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp/issues/89 (get last commit that affects <path>)
