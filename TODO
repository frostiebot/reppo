Flask Author appears to discourage the concept of stacking routes on a
single endpoint.

Instead, it is apparently "better" to make the "odd" routes return the
endpoint you wanted as a function call.

Meh.

TODO:

*   Lang statistics for repo.tree home (summary count of diff. file types)

*   Switch to pygit2 (libgit2)

*   https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp/issues/89

*   Need branch selector for tree and commits views.
    (Branch selector on commits views can also show a sha as "current"
     branch, but the underlying selector still only allows refs)

*   Refs view is unstyled and shit-tastic.

*   Derp. LDAP login protection.

*   /<repo_key>/blame/<rev>/<path:path> (ie. blame view of a blob). bleh.

Order of execution per-request is as follows:
    1. url_value_preprocessor
    2. before_request

Any functions decorated with the above will be executed in the
order they were defined here.

For example, if you have decorate two functions with
url_value_preprocessor, then those functions would be called in
the order they are physically defined in the code, but they would
still both be called *before* any before_request decorated functions
are called.
